  <ol>
    <li>This page is only of interest to those who have used TallyJ version 1, and wish to import those files into version 2.</li>
    <li>
      Version 1 of TallyJ required the use of two XML data files: a Community file with
      the names of all voters, and an Election file with the ballots and votes cast.
    </li>
    <li>
      In Version 2 of TallyJ, which you are using now, all of this information is contained
      in one "Election". Both of the version 1 XML data files can be loaded into the current
      Election via this page.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are beginning an election, only the Community file would need to be loaded.
      The details of this election can be entered on the "Set up the Election" page.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are loading the version 1 files for archival or testing purposes, it is best
      to load both files. However, the Election file can be loaded on its own, and the
      complete election results can be viewed. (The only information missing would be
      the information about who voted, and the participation percentage.)
    </li>

  Step 2: Import data
</h2>
<p>
  If an Election file is selected, all current ballots are replaced with those from the file. All people who were voted for will be added (if not already done).
</p>
<p>
  If a Community file is selected, all people in the file will be added (if not already done).
</p>
<p>
  To clear the current election for a fresh load, click "Delete all People already Added". Then use the "Load Ballots and People" button as needed.
